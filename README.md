# High Resolution Depth Maps for Stable Diffusion WebUI
This script is an addon for [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) that creates `depthmaps` from the generated images. The result can be viewed on 3D or holographic devices like VR headsets or [Looking Glass](https://lookingglassfactory.com/) displays, used in Render- or Game- Engines on a plane with a displacement modifier, and maybe even 3D printed.

To generate realistic depth maps from a single image, this script uses code and models from the [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) repository by Intel ISL (see [https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/](https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/) for more info), or LeReS from the [AdelaiDepth](https://github.com/aim-uofa/AdelaiDepth) repository by Advanced Intelligent Machines. Multi-resolution merging as implemented by [BoostingMonocularDepth](https://github.com/compphoto/BoostingMonocularDepth) is used to generate high resolution depth maps.

>The midas repository will be cloned to /repositories/midas

>The [BoostingMonocularDepth](https://github.com/compphoto/BoostingMonocularDepth) repository will be cloned to /repositories/BoostingMonocularDepth and added to sys.path

>Model `weights` will be downloaded automatically on first use and saved to /models/midas, /models/leres and /models/pix2pix

## Usage
Select the "DepthMap vX.X.X" script from the script selection box in either txt2img or img2img.
![screenshot](options.png)

The models can `Compute on` GPU and CPU, use CPU if low on VRAM. 

There are five models available from the `Model` dropdown, the first four are the midas models: dpt_large, dpt_hybrid, midas_v21, and midas_v21_small. The first one dpt_large is the most recent midas model. See the [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) repository for more info. The dpt_hybrid model yields good results in my experience, and is much smaller than the dpt_large model, which means shorter loading times when the model is reloaded on every run.
For the fifth model, res101, see [AdelaiDepth/LeReS](https://github.com/aim-uofa/AdelaiDepth/tree/main/LeReS) for more info.

Net size can be set with `net width` and `net height`, or will be the same as the input image when `Match input size` is enabled. There is a trade-off between structural consistency and high-frequency details with respect to net size (see [observations](https://github.com/compphoto/BoostingMonocularDepth#observations)). Large maps will also need lots of VRAM.

`Boost` will enable multi-resolution merging as implemented by [BoostingMonocularDepth](https://github.com/compphoto/BoostingMonocularDepth) and will significantly improve the results. Mitigating the observations mentioned above. Net size is ignored when enabled. Best results with res101.

When enabled, `Invert DepthMap` will result in a depthmap with black near and white far.

Regardless of global settings, `Save DepthMap` will always save the depthmap in the default txt2img or img2img directory with the filename suffix '_depth'. Generation parameters are saved with the image if enabled in settings.

To see the generated output in the webui `Show DepthMap` should be enabled. When using Batch img2img this option should also be enabled.

To make the depthmap easier to analyze for human eyes, `Show HeatMap` shows an extra image in the WebUI that has a color gradient applied. It is not saved.

When `Combine into one image` is enabled, the depthmap will be combined with the original image, the orientation can be selected with `Combine axis`. When disabled, the depthmap will be saved as a 16 bit single channel PNG as opposed to a three channel (RGB), 8 bit per channel image when the option is enabled.
> 💡 Saving as any format other than PNG always produces an 8 bit, 3 channel RGB image. A single channel 16 bit image is only supported when saving as PNG.

## FAQ

 * `Can I use this on existing images ?`
    - Yes, in img2img, set denoising strength to 0. This will effectively skip stable diffusion and use the input image. You will still have to set the correct size, and need to select `Crop and resize` instead of `Just resize` when the input image resolution does not match the set size perfectly.
 * `Can I run this on google colab ?`
    - You can run the MiDaS network on their colab linked here https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/
    - You can run BoostingMonocularDepth on their colab linked here : https://colab.research.google.com/github/compphoto/BoostingMonocularDepth/blob/main/Boostmonoculardepth.ipynb
